Global Layoffs Risk Analysis-
SQL Data Modeling & Tableau BI Dashboards

Project Overview
This project analyzes global layoff trends across industries, company stages, time, and geography during a period of economic uncertainty (2020–2023). Using MySQL for data modeling and Tableau for visualization, the goal was to transform raw layoff data into structured, executive-ready business intelligence dashboards that support risk assessment and macroeconomic trend analysis.


Tech Stack

MySQL
- Data cleaning (null handling, date standardization)
- Aggregations & multi-level grouping
- Window functions (ranking, rolling totals)
- View creation for BI-ready datasets
- Structured data modeling for Tableau integration


Tableau
- KPI dashboards
- Geographic mapping
- Industry & stage risk analysis
- Time-series trend analysis
- Interactive filtering


Dashboard Structure

Dashboard 1 — Executive Overview
KPI Cards:
- Total Layoffs
- Companies Affected
- Countries Impacted
- Line Chart: Layoffs Over Time
- Table: Largest Single Layoff Events


Dashboard 2 — Geographic Impact
- Map: Layoffs by Country
- Bar Chart: Top 10 Countries by Total Layoffs


Dashboard 3 — Industry & Business Stage Risk
- Bar Chart: Layoffs by Industry
- Bar Chart: Layoffs by Company Stage


Dashboard 4 — Time Trends & Industry Breakdown
- Line Chart: Layoffs Over Time
- Interactive Filter: Industry
- Bar Charts: Top 5 Impacted Industries per Year


Key Insights
- Consumer and Retail sectors reported the highest cumulative layoffs.
- Transport and Finance industries were also significantly impacted, indicating broad macroeconomic         pressure.
- Layoffs peaked during 2022–2023, marking the period of highest workforce reductions.
- Post-IPO and late-stage companies accounted for a substantial share of total layoffs.
- Workforce reductions were distributed across multiple industries, suggesting systemic economic effects    rather than isolated sector disruption.


What This Project Demonstrates
- End-to-end BI workflow (SQL → structured views → Tableau dashboards)
- Data modeling for dashboard performance and flexibility
- Multi-dashboard architecture design
- Analytical storytelling through visualization
- Executive-level KPI and trend reporting


Data Source
- Public global layoffs dataset (2020–2023).
